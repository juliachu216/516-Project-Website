# Discussion

The best accuracy of neural network is a little bit higher than that of support vector machine. But the ideal accuracy we assumed is over 85%, which is far away the current result. We need to imporve the Raman spectral data of samples. For example, we can extend the exposure time or use 20x microscope objective when collecting samples. We can also add some nano enhancement to improve the Raman spectra.
