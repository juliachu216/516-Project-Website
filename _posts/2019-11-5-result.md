In the scatter plot of PCA, the positions of PC1 and PC2 of most samples are overlapping.  

2. Support Vector Machine

* The best hyperparameter for svc is C=100 and gamma=0.0001 in rbf kernel.
* The accuarcy of svc is 0.646.
* The confusion matrix is

3. Neural Network

* The accuracy of nerual network is 0.669.
* The confusion matrix is

Note: The accuracy and confusion matrix for both methods may change by running model. They are not fixed. The accuarcy of svc is between 0.63 to 0.65. The accuracy of neural network is between 0.5 to 0.67. Even if the accuracy stays a value, the confusion matix may change.
