# Deparaffined samples preparation
All of skin samples were from tail head. They were fixed in formaldehyde, rinsed with ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and put on gold slides finally. After we got gold slides with skin samples, we removed paraffine on samples to detect Raman spectrum. 
To deparaffinize the slides, they have to undergo incubation in xylene followed by a descending alcohol series as follows: 
1. 10min incubation in Xylene
2. 10min incubation in 100% ethanol
3. 10min incubation in 95% ethanol
4. 10min incubation in 70% ethanol
5. 10min incubation in DI water.
