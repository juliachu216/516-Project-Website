# What is Chronic Wasting Disease?
Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a contagious neurological disease affecting deer, elk and moose. It causes a characteristic spongy degeneration of the brains of infected animals resulting in emaciation, abnormal behavior, loss of bodily functions and death.

CWD belongs to a group of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Within this family of diseases, there are several other variants that affect domestic animals: scrapie, which has been identified in domestic sheep and goats for more than 200 years, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle (also known as “mad cow disease”), and transmissible mink encephalopathy in farmed mink.

Several rare human diseases are also TSEs. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) occurs naturally in about one out of every one million people worldwide. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (v-CJD) has been associated with the large-scale outbreak of BSE in cattle herds in Great Britain.

# Why are we concerned about Chronic Wasting Disease?
CWD poses serious problems for wildlife managers, and the implications for free-ranging deer and elk are significant:

* Ongoing surveillance programs are expensive and draw resources from other wildlife management needs.
* Impacts of CWD on population dynamics of deer and elk are presently unknown. Computer modeling suggests that CWD could substantially reduce infected cervid populations by lowering adult survival rates and destabilizing long-term population dynamics.
* Where it occurs, CWD may alter the management of wild deer and elk populations, and it has already begun to do so.
* Ultimately, public and agency concerns and perceptions about human health risks associated with all TSE’s may erode hunters confidence and their willingness to hunt in areas where CWD occurs.
