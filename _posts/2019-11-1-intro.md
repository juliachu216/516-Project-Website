# Machine Learning of Raman Spectrum of Chronic Wasting Disease
{: .text-purple}

We propose to evaluate the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy on skin biopsies from white-tailed deer infected with CWD. We collected Raman spectrum data of deparaffined samples, and compare the accuracy for different machine learning method, support vector machine and neural network.
