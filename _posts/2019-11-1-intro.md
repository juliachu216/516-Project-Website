# Machine Learning of Raman Spectra of Chronic Wasting Disease
{: .text-#663399}

The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of Raman spectroscopy on skin biopsies from white-tailed deer infected with CWD. In other words, what is the accuracy when we separate negative and positive by machine learning successfully? 

The project includes collection of Raman spectra of deparaffined samples, combination of raw spectral data, denoise raw data, classification of data, and comparison of the accuracy in different machine learning methods, support vector machine and neural network.
